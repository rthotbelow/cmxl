The first idea was making a programming language that was similar to xml.

A example:
```xml
<body>
  <print data="hello world" />
</body>
```
Looks simple, right?

But now were just writing our own lexer since i had another idea.
Example of our new idea:
```
log <hello world>
```

<> = strings 

Last final idea before the lexer gets written 

```
log "hello world"
```

It's still kind of the same idea, but without <> as strings so it's LESS confusing.

But we now look kind of like basic lol

Documentation
==============
* `log <arg>` = `log "hello world"`

I know it's small, but were just starting with a simple print command.

And also you can check Documentation.MD for a more cleaner documentation & updated.

But yeah, this is the first programming language ive written. If you don't like this programming language then maybe tell me why and not just "I hate it!", actual criticism please. ^^"
